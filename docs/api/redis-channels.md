## Namespace

First. all channels have a namespace attached to them. this is done to prevent other application to clash with the keys.

The namespace have the following format: `<prefix>::<chain_id>`

* `prefix` is per default `ship` but can be configured to be something else.
* `chain_id` is the chain's id and is used to separate transactions if multiple chains are setup in the same redis database.

## Transactions
